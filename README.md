## How to run demos

First, please move to [demo/](./demo/). 
```
cd demo/
```

Specify a demo to run:
```
run_example(PATH)
```
where PATH is the path of the demo's folder, e.g. './push_recovery/case1/'.

Alternatively, you can use the console designed for executing demos, which is run by:
```
run_example()
```
